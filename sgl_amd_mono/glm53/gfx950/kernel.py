"""GLM-5 indexed decode MonoKernel: one persistent launch per TP rank.

One launch of ``grid = 256 CTAs x 512 threads`` (one CTA per MI355X CU) runs the
whole decoder-layer body for this rank's TP shard.  The indexed path adds the
selection refresh to the same resident grid instead of consuming externally
prepared sparse indices::

    input RMSNorm -> q_a / kv_a projection -> q_a RMSNorm -> q_b (+RoPE)
      -> KV RMSNorm / k_pe RoPE -> KV/PE cache publish
      -> index K/Q/W projection -> index K norm/RoPE/Hadamard/cache
      -> index score -> exact radix top-2048
      -> absorbed q (W_UK) -> sparse MLA split softmax -> merge -> W_UV -> W_o
      -> attention TP peer reduce + residual                      (sym_attn)
      -> post-attention RMSNorm -> router sigmoid + activation FP8 quant
      -> top-8 -> 1 shared + 8 routed expert up/gate/SiLU
      -> mid FP8 quant -> expert down + route weighting
      -> MoE TP peer reduce + residual -> x_out                   (sym_ffn)

Scheduling: every stage is a list of tasks; task ``t`` of a stage runs on CTA
``(stage_base + t) % 256`` and every CTA walks the stages in order.  There is
no grid-wide barrier: dependencies only point to earlier stages and all CTAs
are co-resident, so every spin wait makes progress.

Mailboxes are *tagged pairs*: every 32-bit value a task hands to another CTA
(or GPU) is stored next to this launch's epoch tag, ``(value, tag)``, with
device- (``sc1``) or system-coherent (``sc0 sc1``) 8 / 16-byte stores.  A
consumer polls the payload itself until the tags match, so a hand-off costs
one memory round trip: no store drain, no separate flag, no second load.

GEMVs run on the matrix cores: weights are host-packed (``pack_fp8`` /
``pack_bf16``) or, with ``fp8_shuffled``, read in place in AITER's (16, 16)
layout, so one wave loads 16 rows x 64 k as one contiguous 1 KB, FP8 is
widened exactly to bf16 and fed to ``mfma_f32_16x16x32_bf16`` with the samples
as the N dimension.  Each 64-k chunk's partial is scaled by its f32 block
scale (times any activation scale / route weight) into the accumulator, so the
math is exact block-scaled FP8 on bf16 activations.  Weight loads that do not
depend on upstream results are issued before the task waits for its inputs.

Cross-GPU: each rank pushes its partial rows as tagged pairs into every peer's
symmetric buffer and polls its own; every rank sums the TP partials in rank
order, so all ranks produce bit-identical hidden states (and routing).

    """Return the ``@flyc.jit`` launcher for one rank's whole layer.

    ``timeline=True`` records ``s_memrealtime`` (100 MHz) at the start and end of
    every task, and once its inputs have arrived, into the ``timeline`` buffer:
    int64 ``[sum(task counts), TL_COLS]`` (start, hint seen, inputs staged, compute
    done, end, then free debug marks) in ``stage_tasks`` order.

    ``index_paged=True`` keeps the index keys in SGLang's paged FP8 cache: per
    block, ``index_block_size x 128`` E4M3 values (``index_shuffled``: 16-token x
    16-byte tiles) followed by one power-of-two f32 scale per token, with blocks
    ``index_block_bytes`` apart.  ``req_ids`` picks each row's ``block_table`` row
    (rows ``bt_stride`` entries apart, a launch argument; the rows of one verify
    request may share it), keys cover positions ``0 .. positions[s]``, a key that
    a row of this launch writes is scored from that row's ``index_k8`` pairs (its
    cached FP8 values and scale), and
    the top-k is published as global cache slots to ``out_indices`` at the row's
    ``sparse_kv_indptr`` offset.
    ``index_k_bf16`` reads the index K projection as packed bf16.

    ``dense_experts > 0`` runs a dense MLP instead of the MoE: its intermediate
    dimension is stored as that many expert-shaped slices, every row routes to all
    of them with weight 1, and the router GEMV is skipped. With FP8 experts the
    slots past the slices load nothing.

    ``tokens=True`` (a step's first layer) starts from the step's tokens: ``h_in``
    holds their ids (int32 [S], -1 for a pad row) and ``w_r`` this rank's
    ``vocab_rows`` rows of the vocab-parallel embedding (bf16 [vocab_rows, HIDDEN]).
    The rank that holds a token's row pushes it to every rank (a pad row's zeros come
    from rank 0), which equals the embedding's all-reduce: one rank holds each row.

    ``eh_entry=True`` (a NextN layer) starts from ``eh_proj(enorm(e) | hnorm(h))``:
    ``h_in`` holds the e rows and ``cur_pos`` the h rows (bf16 [S, HIDDEN]; a pad
    row's are read as zeros), and ``timeline_buf`` a pointer table whose entries
    EH_ARGS are this rank's HIDDEN / npes rows of eh_proj (bf16 [rows, 2 * HIDDEN],
    row-major), the enorm and hnorm weights and, with ``tokens``, this rank's
    ``vocab_rows`` embedding rows (entries 0-6 the indexer's, 7 the timeline). Each
    rank computes its rows of x (f32 sums, rounded to bf16) and pushes them to every
    rank, where the layer reads x. With ``tokens`` the e rows come from the token ids
    in ``h_in``, as layer 0's do.

    ``tail=True`` builds the tail instead of a layer: the final RMSNorm of the rows
    ``h_in`` (bf16 [S, HIDDEN]) with weight ``g_in``, written to ``w_o`` (bf16
    [S, HIDDEN]); this rank's ``vocab_rows`` LM-head rows ``w_r`` (bf16, row-major) on
    the normed rows, rounded to bf16 as SGLang's LM head leaves them; and their
    all-gather over the TP ranks into ``x_out`` (f32 [S, vocab_rows * npes]).
